### Exploring Files and Directories

### What is Command Line?
Command line interface, command prompt, command screen, terminal, text interface, and shell are all instances that refer to an environment that receives commands from a user in the form of text. Using the command line interface is an alternative method for interacting with your computer than the commonly known approach, using a mouse to point and click on a computers graphical user interface (gui).

### Why use Command Line?
Because it makes it easier to automate tasks and often it requires fewer steps to implement! As with everything, there is a small learning curve but there are online manuals for users to reference and a help option to review details of a command.

### General Syntax

Let’s get started!
When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a $ prompt, indicating that the shell is waiting for input. Shell typically uses $ as the prompt.

### Print Working Directory
At anytime to find out where you are in your command line interface, you can type pwd. pwd stands for print working directory and can be thought of as places.

Commands mostly read and write files in the current working directory, i.e. ‘here’, so knowing where you are before running a command is important.
