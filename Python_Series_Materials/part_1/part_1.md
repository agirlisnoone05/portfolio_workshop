# Part 1: Introduction to Basic Programming with Data

In this first part of the 3-part workshop series, "Introduction to Python for Data Science," we offer an introduction to Python for non-programmers with a focus on data analysis. In this workshop, we will demonstrate how to do basic Python programming in Jupyter Notebooks. Topics will include working with different data types, using built-in functions and libraries like Pandas to read and manipulate data. Part 2 will offer an extensive tutorial on Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab, and part 3 will expand on the programming skills covered in this part, covering more advanced techniques on plotting and analyzing data.

**Date:** February 7, 2023   
**Time:** 1:00-3:00 pm   
**Location:** The Den, Sorrells Library
