## Workshop Exercises 

In set of exercises, we will be:

* Creating and collaborating on OSF projects
* Using project templates
* Uploading files from your desktop
* Connecting external platforms like Google Drive, Mendeley, and GitHub
* Understanding version control in OSF

If you haven't already, download [the workshop files](https://github.com/cmu-lib/portfolio_workshop/blob/main/OSF_Materials/files/20230213_OSF_files.zip?raw=true) and save them in a folder on your desktop. Make sure to extract the files from the zip file.


### Exercise 1 Copy a template from an existing project
* Once you've signed into your account, choose Search from the menu at the top of the page and search for "CMU Getting Started with OSF Demo".
* Click on the project from the search results. Find the 'fork' button in the upper righthand corner and choose 'Duplicate template' from the drop-down menu.
* Click 'Create' when prompted. You should now have a clean template of the project in your own account without any files or add-ons.
* If you'd like, change the name of the project by clicking on the project name.

### Exercise 2 Add contributors to your project
* Add your neighbor as a contributor by clicking on Contributors from the menu at the top of the project page and then the green "+ Add" button.

### Exercise 3 Create a new component
* Return to the project's home page by clicking on the project name in the upper left.

### Exercise 4 Add files to a component

* Click on OSF Storage in the files section of the Survey Instrument component. Click on **'+ Create Folder'** to add a new folder.
* Name this folder 'Surveys', then click the green plus **+** to add the new file.
* Click on the folder and add the file 'Survey-Instrument\_RDM-Practices-in-MRI\_VanGulick\_Borghi.pdf' from the workshop files that you downloaded before today's session. You can either drag and drop the file to the Survey folder or click **'Upload'** and browse to the file.
* Now try adding the files 'Borghi\_VanGulick\_2018\_data.csv' and 'Borghi\_VanGulick\_2018\_datadictionary.csv' to the Data component.

### Exercise 5 Change the privacy settings

* Delete the first two columns and save without changing the file name.
* Replace the file in your data component with the new version by dragging and dropping or uploading to the Data component OSF storage, where the previous version is located.
